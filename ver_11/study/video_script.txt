Wolf3d Demonstration

So let's see a demo of what you can do for your wolf3D. At the begnniing your
walls will all be from the same color to simplify things. We muust be able to 
move around a maze. You'll noticed that ground and ceiling have the same color
by now.

Now it's a litle bit complex the wall of the maze are now colored differently
depending on orientation. Now the ground has another color. 

Next step is to add textures on walls. By now it's the same fexture everywhere.
you can put objects using sprites. Objects that can be in the middle of the way.
and even like in this case that can block the way.

Now we can add wall with different textures, objects that goes upp to the ceiling
and imagine for blocking objects door that require an action to be opened. In my
case I'll press space and the door opens.

Some other example of decoration or pick up objects. I got an object here. And 
I got a notification of value. A more complex door that doesn't open by pressing
space and notify that it's locked. We'll then require an access badge. When we 
pick it up. See it is in an action bar. Now if we try again to open the door by
pressing space. It works.

A new features with less luminosity. Now we have textures on the floor and 
ceiling. more pick up objects. new texture on the ground. and now no more
texture on the ceiling but something we call a skybox.It's basically a box 
or a sphere all around the maze.

Now let's try some walls that aren't squared or perpendicular anymore but slanted
using triangles which will complexity. The path finding inside the maze. Same
thing for floor well now face a ground with different levels like stairs.

we can crouch. And here is a lot of features all together, floors, wall, 
objects, thinner pillars. meet different levels, crouch or jump. We could also
fly using a jetpack. if you noticed the jetpack has a limited autonomy bottom
right.

You could implement teleportation to go to another place or another maze.
Now put transparent texture on the walls to allow us to see the skybox around.
In a corner you noticed a fan. that's actually an animated object.
